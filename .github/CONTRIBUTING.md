Wanting to contribute to the development of the plugin? Great!

Please just make sure you follow these guidelines to make my life easier:
 1. Please ensure you start each new pull request from the master branch of the main repo, otherwise you will be asked
 to update your branch
 2. When making multiple changes to the plugin, please issue separate pull requests for each feature you work on. This
  allows me to pick and choose things without worry of conflicts within the merge process.
